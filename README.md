# UKTT

Uktt provides a way to work with the UK Trade Tariff API, https://api.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/#gov-uk-trade-tariff-api.

###  Features

- Fetches sections, chapters, headings, commodities, goods_nomenclatures, monetary exchange rates, and quota definitions from the Tariff API
- Tests local, production, and any other Frontend API servers using real (not mocked) API calls
- Command-line interface

## Installation

The repository is here: __https://github.com/trade-tariff/uktt/__

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'uktt'
```

## Usage

Set options in the http client and pass the client to different resources

```ruby
# Instantiate a new http client with options:
host =  'http://localhost:3002', # use a local frontend server
version =  'v2',                 # `v1` and `v2` are supported
debug =  false,                  # dislays request and response info
connection = nil                 # Pass a Faraday connection object to inject middleware or leave default configuration with nil
format =  'jsonapi'              # ostruct, json or json api formatted json

client = Uktt::Http.new(host, version, debug, connection, format)

# Fetch a single section or all sections
section_id = '1'
section = Uktt::Section.new(client)
response = section.retrieve(section_id)
response = section.retrieve_all
````
### Quota search

Retrieve quota definitions, optionally filtered by various criteria. The search criteria are passed-in with a hash:

```ruby
criteria = {
  goods_nomenclature_item_id: '0805102200',
  year: '2018',
  geographical_area_id: 'EG',
  order_number: '091784',
  status: 'not blocked',
  critical: 'N'
}
quotas = Uktt::Quota.new(client)
quotas.search(criteria)

# => #<OpenStruct data=[#<OpenStruct id="12202", type="definition", attributes=#<OpenStruct quota_definition_sid=12202, quota_order_number_id="091784" ... >>]>
```
### Goods nomenclatures

Retrieves goods nomenclatures by heading, chapter, or section.

E.g., use a heading object to retrieve all associated goods nomenclatures:

```ruby
> h = Uktt::Heading.new(heading_id: '0101')
> h.goods_nomenclatures

# => #<OpenStruct data=[#<OpenStruct id="27624", type="goods_nomenclature", attributes=#<OpenStruct goods_nomenclature_item_id="0101000000", ... >>]>
```

## Development

While developing the gem, and for use outside of a Rails app, I found it useful to have a console:

```bash
$ bundle console
```

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` (or `bundle console` outside of a rails app) for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
